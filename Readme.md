## Architecture and Patterns:
StreamLab follows a client-server architecture, with the following components:

1. MVC:
    #### MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a software architectural pattern commonly used in designing and developing web applications.
    - In MVC, the "Model" represents the data and business logic of the application. It handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
    - The "View" is responsible for displaying the user interface, presenting the data to the users in a visually appealing way. 
    - The "Controller" acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input, processes it, and updates the Model or the View accordingly.

2. N-Tier:
    #### Application consists of 4 layers
   1. **Interfaces** (Class library, entities's interfaces);
   2. **DAL** (Class library and Context);
   3. **BL** (Class library, Business logic, references the two projects above 1 and 2);
   4. **Web** (ASP.NET MVC application, Presentation Layer, references two projects 1 and 3);

3. Database:
   - Stores movie and TV show data, user information, and user preferences.
   - Can be implemented using relational databases like MsSql, MySQL or PostgreSQL.
   - Ensures data consistency, integrity, and scalability.
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div style="margin: 20px;">
            <img src="userDbDisign.png" alt="Image Description" width="300px" height="180px" />
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 20px;">
            <img src="MovieDbDesign.png" alt="Image Description" width="300px" height="180px" />
        </div>
    </div>

4. Generic Repository:
    - **CRUD Operations**: The generic repository supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for entities.
    - **Flexible Entity Types**: You can use the generic repository with various entity types by providing the appropriate type parameter.
    - **Data Source Agnostic**: The repository is designed to work with different data sources, such as databases, file systems, or external APIs.
